## Columbia University

My dissertation research, under the advisement of [Dr. Shuang Wang](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/sw2206) at Columbia University and [Dr. Colin Begg](https://www.mskcc.org/profile/colin-begg) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, focuses on statistical methods for the study of etiologic heterogeneity. The first part of my research focused on comparing and contrasting existing methods for the study of etiologic heterogeneity using a simulation study and simplified data example. Next, I examined the statistical properties of our method for the study of etiologic heterogeneity to determine its ability to find the truly most etiologically heterogeneous subtype solutions under a variety of data settings. Finally, I am applying the method to data from the Carolina Breast Cancer Study, and exploring additional methodological challenges that exist in a real data analysis.

## Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

At Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center I spent six years collaborating on research projects in genito-urinary cancers, with an emphasis on genetic predictors of patient outcomes. Since then I have worked with the breast surgery service on research comparing patient outcomes according to different treatment strategies. I have also collaborated closely with epidemiologists on research related to smoking and bladder cancer and with health outcomes researchers on long-term outcomes following treatment for lymphoma.
